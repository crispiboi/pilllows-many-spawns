title=Pillow's Many Spawns Project
description=This is a work in progress mod, implemented for all vanilla professions. There are 885 hand picked spawn points across the entire map.Many of these spots are businesses or interesting locations across the map. As a design decision, I excluded the military base as a spawn area.

description=So many thanks to blindcoder's tool that allows me to easily see these locations and pinpoint the coordinates https://map.projectzomboid.com/

description=Planned Roadmap is to implement By Location/By Profession hybrid, some additional variations and roleplay scenarios. I will also consider adding scenarios that the community brings up.

description=Variations of mod are packed as separate sub-mods that need to be enabled for those options to show on the spawn selection menu.
